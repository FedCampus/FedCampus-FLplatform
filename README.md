# Project Overview

## Project Introduction

Federated learning is a machine learning technique that trains a model across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples without sharing data, thus allowing it to address critical issues such as data privacy, security, access rights, and access to heterogeneous data. Its applications are spread over several industries.

One related area with FL is edge computing, where the parties are edge devices. Many studies try to integrate FL with mobile edge systems. The clients (e.g., an app running on mobile phones) store the necessary training data locally (with limited time and quantity). In many cases, the app will already have stored this data (e.g., a text messaging app must store text messages, and a photo management app already stores photos). However, in some cases, additional data or metadata might need to be maintained, e.g., user interaction data, to provide labels for a supervised learning task.

## FL Tasks in FedCampus (Model Training & Deployment)

* **Sleep tracking:** track sleep patterns (FL prediction on next days), **s**_**leep quality prediction**_ (other labelled data, and FL model deployment)_._
* **Track physical activity:** Federated learning to track physical activity, such as _**steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned.**_ This information can be used to improve fitness and reduce the risk of obesity and other chronic diseases.
* **Personalize recommendations:** Federated learning to _**personalize recommendations**_ for physical activity, such as suggested workouts or goals. This information can help users stay motivated and reach their fitness goals.

* ....

These are just a few examples of the many ways that federated learning can be used on wearable devices' data. As federated learning technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of this technology in the future.
