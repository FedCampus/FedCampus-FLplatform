## Objectives

{% hint style="info" %}
What to do. To achieve these objectives, what should you learn, e.g., techniques? For example, to start research on federated learning:
{% endhint %}

* Challenges in FL
  * Statistical Heterogeneity
  * System Heterogeneity&#x20;
* Existing Solutions
  * Algorithms: FedAvg, FedProx...
* Improve FedAvg on Non-IID
  * Algorithm implementation (PyTorch or Tensorflow)
  * Theorem for bounded weight divergence
  * Experiment setup

## Process&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
How to do. To achieve your objectives, how do you make progress, e.g., reading papers? For example, to start research on federated learning:
{% endhint %}

| Objectives                       | Process                                     | Time           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Challenges in FL                 | Read survey papers (...)                    | 2023.1.1-1.10  |
| Existing Solutions               | Read corresponding papers                   | 2023.1.11-1.13 |
| Improve FedAvg on Non-IID-Stage1 | Implement FedAvg using PyTorch (simulation) | 2023.1.15-1.20 |

## Reflections & Thoughts (Optional)

{% hint style="info" %}
What you learn. After each process you made, what have you gained and your innovative insights? For example, to start research on federated learning:
{% endhint %}

* Challenges in FL from survey papers: the lack of information for optimization, the tradeoff between statistical and system utility, and expensive Communication (ref. ...)
