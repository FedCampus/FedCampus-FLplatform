## Up till now

- Integrated `org.eu.fedcampus.train` into `FedCampus_APP`.
- Silly `simple_health_kit` model that predicts 3 classes of distance from 2
    input: steps and calories.
- `dyn_flower_android_drf` tracks `TrainingDataType` and advertise models
    accordingly.

## Up till 2023/6/8

- Meet with Aicha to overview `dyn_flower_android` and the customizations it
    provides for her federated learning.
    - Walk Aicha through the demo and the logic of the process.
- Meet with Johnny & Tianjun to specify deployment tasks.
- Integrating training package into FedCampus_APP with Beilong.
    - Created [MonoRepo][MonoRepo] to group FedCampus_APP and
        dyn_flower_android_drf together.
    - [Imported org.eu.fedcampus.train from dyn_flower_android_drf into
        FedCampus_APP](https://github.com/FedCampus/FedCampus_APP/commit/68a3444aa9e5ef4d4ab1e300beaf8b0f37e6010c).
    - Tested `tflite_convertor/convert_to_tflite.py` to verify that it is still
        able to generate the 5 `.tflite` files.
        - Failed to make the script run on my ARM Mac after trying multiple
            Python and Tensorflow versions.
        - [Opened an issue on the Flower repo](https://github.com/adap/flower/issues/1911)
            to address the breakage.
        - Got it running on Beilong's x86_64 Windows machine.
- Start to add telemetry to `org.eu.fedcampus.train`.
    - Togglable using an argument.
    - Sends client, session, and timing data to backend on training events.
- Persuaded Beilong to write nice commit messages and format code.

## Up till 2023/5/26

- [`dyn_flower_android` client side](https://github.com/FedCampus/dyn_flower_android_drf/pull/4):
    - Convert `flwr.android_client` from Java to Kotlin and use suspend
        functions.
    - Extract training functionality from `MainActivity` into
        `org.eu.fedcampus.train` to work towards a standalone library.
    - Upgraded `org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite` dependency.
    - DB using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room#kotlin).
        - Check if the models are already downloaded to prevent redownloading.
        - Restore user input on launch.
            - Needed [Room migration](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/migrating-db-versions).
            - Also needed to [store schema](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44322178/room-schema-export-directory-is-not-provided-to-the-annotation-processor-so-we).
- `FedCampus_APP`:
    - [Discuss the need for better commit messages](https://github.com/FedCampus/FedCampus_APP/issues/4).
    - [Discuss Kotlin support](https://github.com/FedCampus/FedCampus_APP/issues/3).

        <details>

        Currently, Beilong is writing this App in Java because he is more
        productive in Java.
        I suggest that we want the null safety from Kotlin and we will probably
        need to migrate to Kotlin, at least partially, when we want to use
        suspend functions.

## Up till 2023/5/18

- Started [dyn_flower_android_drf](https://github.com/SichangHe/dyn_flower_android_drf)
    - Django REST server serve TFLite model files and their information.
    - Android client ask for TFLite model files, download them onto disk,
        and start `FlowerClient` using the model downloaded.
        - Implemented to load model anywhere on disk instead of in `assets/`:
            `org/tensorflow/lite/examples/transfer/api/ExternalModelLoader.kt`.
    - Django server launch Flower server in background process.
        - Studied Selery, Huey, and APScheduler, and landed on using
            `multiprocessing` directly.
    - Tried saving model parameters in the background Flower process using a
        custom `Strategy`, but it does not work because
        `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.`.
    - Spawn a new process for each server requested.
        - Spawn a thread to monitor it so that it could save the parameters
            to DB.
        - Restore old parameters from DB at Flower server start.

## Up till 2023/4/21

- `flower` uses `protobuf` to *generate* language-specific gRPC stub code.
- In Android example, the TFLite model is hard-coded:
    - Data parsing functions have data semantics hard-coded and
        and run at data load.
    - No encoded way to transfer model (`.tflite`) files.
    - The TFLite API used (`TransferLearningModel`) is model-agnostic.
        Potential to easily swap models.
- Consider an extra connection layer in front of `flower`.
    - `flower` has sophisticated gRPC configurationâ€”hard to fiddle with.
    - Keeping `flower` contained and in one piece is beneficial for future
        compatibility.
    - Can use Django to spawn flower servers and reverse proxy to them.
    - Consider using Django to spawn flower servers on new ports,
        and tell clients to connect to them at the ports.

## Up till 2023/04/10

- Study how `flower` works.
    - The `strategy` handles most custom logic on server side.
    - Order of connection and training managed/hardcoded.
        - Start training after connection established.
        - No resume.
        - No sleep option.

- Studied [FedML Android demo][fedml-android-demo].
    - Requires manually cloning MNN and configuring Cpp toolchain to build.
    - Uses JNI to call Cpp function from Java.
    - FedML wants you to use their platform as a service,
        register an account, connect your app to them and manage online.
    - Android SDK API documents are basically nonexistent.
- Read FedML Android SDK codebase because no documentation.

- Checked out the previous Android app `FedC`.
    - The app architecture is similar in Java, although the UI uses XML.
    - `org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3` handles MQTT.
    - The connection blocks the main thread, causing UI lag.
- Nuked Kotlin and related work out of the plan.
- Looked for Android developers tutorial for Java instead.
    - Hard to find because most are in Kotlin.

## Up till 2023/03/05

- Read FedML background materials.
- Ran FedML demo Python simulation.
- Tried Android Studio, Kotlin, JetPack Compose.
- Sketched tech stack plan for the Android platform.

<details>
<summary>Java + FedML Java API, Django + FedML Python API + PostgreSQL, HTTPS poll</summary>

Jiaqi asked me for a formal tech stack plan for the Android platform, here is my current sketch:

Android client app: Single Java app shipped to the user.

- Data gathering: UI, user data collection and handling, and HTTPS client in Java.
- ML: Call FedML's Java API for local training.

Server: Single modular Python server with single database.

- Python as language of choice to best support ML exploration.
- ML module:
    - Call FedML's Python API from the server for aggregation.
- Web module: gather and store data.
    - Django for HTTPS server and database interface (ORM).
    - PostgreSQL for database.

HTTPS does not support broadcasting, and we cannot assume that the clients would always be on. So, I assume that the clients will poll the server for new information ever so often. We only need to implement a REST API or something equivalent for the communication.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    K(Java Android app)-->|directly call|J(FedML Java API);
    K-->|poll|S(Django Server)
    S-->|respond|K
    S-->|communicate|D(PostgreSQL)
    S-->|use API|M(Python ML module)
    M-->|call|P(FedML Python API)
```

</details>

- Looked for full-duplex communication protocol as demanded by Jiaqi.

<summary>Need an external push service.</summary>

For [Push API][Push API], I only found [instruction to make push messages][make-push-message] which is for web apps. Unofficial instructions to make push messages to Android exist on [Intercom Developers][intercom-push-notifications] and [Iterable][iterable-push-notifications], both of which use Firebase for the push service.

My *conclusion* is that we should consider these after we have a working poll model because they involve external services.
