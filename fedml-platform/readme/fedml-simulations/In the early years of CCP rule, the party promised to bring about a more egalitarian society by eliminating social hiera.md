In the early years of CCP rule, the party promised to bring about a more egalitarian society by eliminating social hierarchies and promoting social mobility. As a result, many groups, such as workers, peasants, and women, experienced an improvement in their social status and access to education and healthcare. The CCP's land reform policies also benefited poor peasants, who were able to acquire land previously owned by wealthy landlords.

However, other groups, such as intellectuals, business owners, and members of the bourgeoisie, experienced a loss of social status or faced persecution during various political campaigns. During the Cultural Revolution, intellectuals and others deemed to be part of the "bourgeoisie" were often publicly humiliated and subjected to violence. Business owners and entrepreneurs were also targeted during this period, as the CCP sought to eliminate private enterprise.

In recent years, the CCP has focused on promoting economic growth and modernization, and as a result, urban residents and members of the middle class have benefited from increased economic opportunities and access to consumer goods. However, rural residents and members of minority ethnic groups have not always fared as well and have faced various forms of discrimination and marginalization.



One possible argument that could be made using passages from the Mitter and van de Ven readings to analyze Lary's work is related to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) approach to modernization and its impact on various social groups.

In their book "China's War with Japan, 1937-1945: The Struggle for Survival," Mitter and van de Ven argue that the war against Japan transformed Chinese society and accelerated the process of modernization. They note that the CCP's wartime experience helped to shape its approach to governance and modernization in the postwar period:

"The war with Japan confirmed the Communist Party's long-held belief in the need for rapid, radical social and economic change if China were to survive as a modern state. The stresses and opportunities of war enabled the Party to implement radical policies, and laid the basis for the more successful efforts of the 1950s." (Mitter and van de Ven, p. 3)

This emphasis on rapid and radical change is also evident in Lary's work, particularly in her analysis of the Great Leap Forward. Lary argues that the CCP's pursuit of rapid modernization through this campaign led to disastrous consequences, particularly for rural peasants:

"The Great Leap was characterized by a strong emphasis on speed and scale, a belief that industrialization and agriculture could be transformed overnight by mobilizing the masses, and a utopian belief in the possibility of overcoming nature and human nature through sheer willpower." (Lary, p. 111)

However, Lary also notes that the CCP's modernization efforts did bring benefits to some groups, particularly urban residents:

"Despite the excesses of the Great Leap, the period did bring significant improvements to the lives of many Chinese people, particularly in urban areas. Industrialization, despite its social and environmental costs, created new jobs and raised living standards for many." (Lary, p. 115)

By comparing and contrasting these different perspectives on the CCP's approach to modernization, one can argue that while the party's emphasis on rapid change brought benefits to some groups, it also had significant negative consequences for others, particularly rural peasants. This demonstrates the importance of considering multiple readings and perspectives when analyzing complex historical events and their impacts on different social groups.
