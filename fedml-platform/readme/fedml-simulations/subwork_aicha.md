* 12/4

Deepened my knowledge about algorithm design more spceifically FedAvg. I looked for papers about this algorithm and chose to start with this one: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629.pdf 

Currently trying to understand the math behind this algorithm by reading lectures about it. For example:
https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-F18/scribes/Lecture_9.pdf;
https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/courseware/Week4/gradient_descent/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AMITx%2B6.036%2B1T2019%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40gradient_descent
