# Subwork\_Tianjun

## **Progress**<br>

### ~ 4/6

$1.$ Read the code in `FedML/distributed/FedAvg`

### ~ 4/3

$1.$ Successfully run simulations and programs in `python/app` , and handled the issue with open-mpi. I open a Ubuntu 22.04 vcm on the dku platform to handle this. (It seems my arm Mac cannot run open-mpi successfully, might be affected by mpich contradiction). <br>

$2.$ Also trying to test this subwork_template
