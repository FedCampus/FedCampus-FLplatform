# Subwork\_Tianjun

**Progress**<br>

$1.$ Successfully run simulations and programs in `python/app` , and handled the issue with open-mpi. I open a Ubuntu 22.04 vcm on the dku platform to handle this. (It seems my arm Mac cannot run open-mpi successfully, might be affected by mpich contradiction). <br>



(Also trying to test this subwork_template)
