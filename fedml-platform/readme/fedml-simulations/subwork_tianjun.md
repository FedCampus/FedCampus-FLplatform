# Subwork\_Tianjun

## **Progress**<br>

### ~ 4/10

$1.$ Read many codes in FedML. Now figure out `FedML/python/examples/centralized/main.py` is the core code to `load` `train` , `FedML/python/fedml/cli/` has main codes of communicate and aggregate. 

$2.$ Read about FedProx.

##### FedProx

Different epochs

With limit local updates, it does not need to manually set the epochs 

$3.$ Rebuild the anaconda, now FedML simulations can be run on my own computer; Flower installed

### ~ 4/6

$1.$ Read the code in `FedML/python/fedml/distributed/FedAvg`, which is the core of FedAvg <br>
$2.$ Watched a movie Tutorial of FedML, Link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jK411N7gS?vd_source=9ebbad46fdc1ff2caa82dc1a6ae88e96 <br>

### ~ 4/3

$1.$ Successfully run simulations and programs in `python/app` , and handled the issue with open-mpi. I open a Ubuntu 22.04 vcm on the dku platform to handle this. (It seems my arm Mac cannot run open-mpi successfully, might be affected by mpich contradiction). <br>

$2.$ Also trying to test this subwork_template <br>
