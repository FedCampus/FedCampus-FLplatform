# Subwork\_Tianxuan

**Progress**<br>
Tested the FedAvg single process simulation with the step-by-step example. Including setting up the Python environment with Conda, installing FedML and learned the steps of testing the method to change parameters with YAML file.<br> 
Started running other examples provided that implements logistic regression with MINST dataset<br>
		

**To dos**<br>
Test other examples that implement machine learning method including CNN and ResNet<br>
Learn about the algorithm of FedAvg and its application<br>
Update simulation results and questions to the subwork page<br>
